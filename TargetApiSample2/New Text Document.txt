In today’s quick video, I’m gonna explain how to create a read-only DbContext in EF Core, perfect for scenarios where you only need to fetch data without modifying it—like reporting, dashboards, or simply improving performance by avoiding unnecessary tracking.
So, let’s dive in! In EF Core, a DbContext is designed to track changes to your entities, but if you're only reading data, tracking is just overhead. To create a read-only DbContext, you can disable change tracking by setting ChangeTracker. This tells EF Core to skip tracking  changes, which makes your queries faster and uses less memory.
Here’s how you do it: set this in your DI setup by configuring your services like this:
This simple tweak ensures that all queries are no-tracking by default, making your DbContext truly read-only!
And that’s it! By setting up a read-only DbContext, you can optimize your application’s performance for read-heavy scenarios with minimal effort. And also You do not need to use Dapper to gain better performance with database queries.
